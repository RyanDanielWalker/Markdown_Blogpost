##### I'm Tired

Today was _rough_ . Not really, but for the sake of this blog post, today was _rough_ .

Here is a list of all of the reasons why today was rough:
* I'm tired
* My body aches
* I'm lonely
* I'm tired

[Here is what I look like today](www.sleep.com) 

Did I mention that I'm **tired**? 

Waking up early has not been *easy*, that's for sure.
